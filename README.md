# Website - The World Of Drones
Welcome to the world of drones
This website provides a collection of articles about drones. Users can register and log in to access all content, while guests see only a subset of articles. Admins have an additional page to view, delete and sort registered users.

## How It Works

**Visitor Browses Articles**

* As a guest, the site shows only a few select articles.
* To unlock the rest, the visitor clicks “Register” and submits their details.

**Registration & Data Storage**

* Registration form fields are validated and stored in an SQL database.
* After successful registration, the user can log in.

**Login & Access Control**

* On login, the server checks credentials against the SQL table.
* If valid, a session is created so the user stays authenticated.
* Regular users see the full article list; admins have an extra link to manage users.

**Admin User Management Page**

* Only users with an “admin” flag in the database see this page.
* It displays all registered accounts in a sortable table and can also delete users.
